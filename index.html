        <h2>Problem statement: Workout Application</h2>
        <p>
          I want to create a nutrition app that will also take account of when you should eat and how much you should eat each meal.
          It will also take in calories burned and your goals for each day.

        <p>
          This Affinity Diagram is mainly made to visualize the design goals and hurdles around the project that we are currently working on.
          It really helps put the project in perspective and helps set realistic goals.

        <p>
          I made these two personas to show one of the primary consumers that i believe would show the biggest consumer of the app in general due to technological literacy among younger audiences.
          I also made a back end admin role to showcase the needs of the developers within the application.

          The Storyboard depicts Naomi's life without the app and the effects that not having the app can have on her long term goals and life.
