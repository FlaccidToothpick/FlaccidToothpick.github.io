        <p>
          I want to create a nutrition app that will also take account of when you should eat and how much you should eat each meal.
          It will also take in calories burned and your goals for each day.

        <p>
          This Affinity Diagram is mainly made to visualize the design goals and hurdles around the project that we are currently working on.
          It really helps put the project in perspective and helps set realistic goals.
